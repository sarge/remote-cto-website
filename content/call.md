We would love to talk to you and see how we can help. 

Yes! You can talk to us **directly!**

In exchange for that we do ask you to make a couple of promises before you do.

* We ask that you think about what your **biggest problem is**.

* **No more than 2** people on the call. We ask this because too many people in the call will slow down the call. We also ask that one of the people is a **decision maker**. 

*If you can't get a decision maker to invest 20 minutes on talking about your biggest engineering challenge, then our suggestion is that you start with that problem first.*

Twenty minutes *is not a lot of time*, so we need to be very **intentional**.
