### We offer to come and kick the tyres on what you have built

We bring our experience along with your business objectives to help make a reasoned recommendation to do one of the following:
* **continue** - what you are doing
* **pause** - it works but is not worth investing in
* **move** - migrate away from the approach being used
* **restart** - it is not fit for purpose and your goals

There are some reasons why your current team might not be ideal for making this assessment:
* You are using a vendor

    Using vendors makes a lot of sense, however this does create a bias which is difficult to exclude from any decision making that the vendor makes on your behalf.

* Your team is too close to the problem
    
    Sometimes when solutions are not working there is a tendency to double down on the approach. As humans we can sometimes find it difficult to admit when we have made a mistake. This can blind us from seeing the big picture.

* there is a loss of trust with your development team

    Software development is a complex process, that isn't well understood by people outside of the industry. Those in the industry are also prone to underestimate the complexity involved. With a miss match of expectations can bring a loss of trust between teams. We can help bring some clarity to the situation and make recommendations to help realign all parties. Couples therapy for software development.
