We are here in service to **you** and **your goals**. Our aim is to help you and get out of your way as quickly as possible. We call this our **In-and-Out** model. We believe that this gives your excellent value for money and you don't need to be worried about us trying to upsell you something.

Your typical consultancy will offer you *Architecture* and *Consultancy* as part of their offering, but in **reality** this is a sales solution in **disguse**. The good people in these roles will often try to keep this conflict at arms length, but in reality it is a bias that is difficult to ignore and will push solutions towards the options that their consultancy offers and not the most effective solution for you. 

We aim to break this model by not offering direct solutions. We have no affliations or kickbacks of any kind. This keeps our motivations as pure as we can make them.

In fact we strive to limit our engagement to **6 months at most!** I know it seems crazy and even counter productive to running a business. In our experience we offer the biggest return at the start of an engagement, we then let you run with our recommendations. During this phase that we call the **cooling off phase**, you are implementing the strategies suggested. This bedding in time allows you implement changes at a pace that feels achievable to you and your team. We are available to re-engage after this time to either follow up on how it is going or ideally start working on your next most important problem.

We will speak to you in a clear and direct manner, and will be as honest as possible. This might not always be easy to hear, but we believe that being clear is being kind.

We love the simplicty of this model and hope you will to.
